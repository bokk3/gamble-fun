# Poker Game Debugging Status

## Project Overview
**Gamble Fun Casino** - Full-stack poker game with React frontend, Node.js backend, MySQL database, and real-time WebSocket communication.

**Primary User Goal**: "I just wanna see a flop xd" - Get poker game to progress past pre-flop to show community cards.

## ‚úÖ Issues Successfully Fixed

### 1. **Field Mapping Issues** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Frontend not showing players due to API field name mismatches.

**Root Cause**: API returned snake_case (`user_id`, `seat_position`) but frontend expected camelCase (`userId`, `seatPosition`).

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Backend API** (`/backend/src/routes/poker.ts`): Fixed field mapping in SQL queries
```sql
-- Fixed field aliases
ps.user_id as userId,
ps.seat_position as seatPosition,
ps.current_bet as currentBet,
ps.last_action as lastAction,
ps.is_active as isActive,
ps.is_all_in as isAllIn,
CASE WHEN ps.last_action = 'fold' THEN true ELSE false END as isFolded,
CASE WHEN ps.user_id < 0 THEN true ELSE false END as isAI
```

- **Frontend Data Transformation** (`/frontend/src/pages/games/PokerGame.tsx`): Updated field mapping
```tsx
// Fixed field references
userId: p.userId,           // was p.user_id
seatPosition: p.seatPosition, // was p.seat_position
currentBet: p.currentBet,   // was p.current_bet
isActive: !!p.isActive,     // was p.is_active
isFolded: !!p.isFolded,     // computed from lastAction
isAI: !!p.isAI              // was p.is_ai
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Players now display correctly around poker table

### 2. **Turn Detection Logic Missing** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Action buttons not showing despite correct game state.

**Root Cause**: WebSocket connection unstable, so frontend used API fallback but API data fetch didn't include turn detection logic.

**Solution Applied**: Added turn detection to `fetchTableState` function
```tsx
// Added to PokerGame.tsx after API fetch
const currentPlayer = tableState.players.find(p => p.userId === user?.id);
const isMyTurn = currentPlayer && 
  tableState.currentPlayerPosition === currentPlayer.seatPosition &&
  !currentPlayer.isFolded && 
  !currentPlayer.isAllIn &&
  currentPlayer.isActive;
setIsPlayerTurn(!!isMyTurn);
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Turn detection logic now works for API fallback

### 3. **WebSocket Table Memory Issues** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: "Table not found" error when clicking action buttons.

**Root Cause**: WebSocket handler couldn't find table in memory (`this.tables.get(tableId)` returned undefined).

**Solution Applied**: Added table initialization to `handlePlayerAction` in `/backend/src/socket/pokerHandler.ts`
```typescript
// Initialize table in memory if not exists
if (!pokerTable) {
  console.log(`No poker table found in memory for table ${tableId}, initializing for action`);
  const newTable: PokerTable = { /* table structure */ };
  this.tables.set(tableId, newTable);
  // Load players from database into memory
}
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ "Table not found" error resolved

### 4. **JSON Parsing Errors** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: "Failed to process action" due to JSON parsing errors on `hole_cards` field.

**Root Cause**: Code tried to `JSON.parse()` data that was already a parsed object.

**Solution Applied**: Safe JSON parsing in poker handler
```typescript
// Safe parsing - check if string before parsing
cards: dbPlayer.hole_cards ? 
  (typeof dbPlayer.hole_cards === 'string' ? 
    JSON.parse(dbPlayer.hole_cards) : dbPlayer.hole_cards) : []
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ JSON parsing errors resolved

## ‚ùå Current Outstanding Issues

### 1. **"Player not at table" WebSocket Error** ‚ùå ACTIVE
**Current Error**: 
```
Poker error: Player not at table
```

**Analysis**: 
- ‚úÖ Demo user exists in database (user_id = 1, seat_position = 6)
- ‚úÖ User has hole cards (K‚ô• A‚ô†) 
- ‚úÖ It's user's turn (current_player_position = 6)
- ‚úÖ Table initialization code runs
- ‚ùå Player lookup in memory fails: `pokerTable.players.get(userId)` returns undefined

**Root Cause Hypothesis**: Database query in WebSocket handler might not be loading the demo user correctly into memory, or the user_id mapping is incorrect.

**Next Steps Needed**:
1. Add debug logging to see what players are loaded into WebSocket memory
2. Verify the database query in `handlePlayerAction` returns user_id = 1
3. Check if AI players vs human players are handled differently in loading logic

### 2. **Database Cleanup System Interference** ‚ùå ACTIVE
**Issue**: Automated cleanup removes "inactive" human players from tables.

**Evidence**: 
```
backend-1  | üëã Removed 1 inactive human players after 10 minutes
```

**Impact**: User gets removed from table between sessions, requiring manual re-joining.

**Solution Needed**: 
- Adjust cleanup criteria to not remove players who are actively playing
- Or implement proper session management to keep active users

### 3. **WebSocket Connection Instability** ‚ùå ONGOING
**Symptoms**: Frequent disconnections, CORS errors, fallback to API polling.

**Evidence from logs**:
```
‚ùå Disconnected from server: io client disconnect
WebSocket failed, fetching table state via API
```

**Impact**: Real-time updates don't work, action buttons depend on API polling instead of live WebSocket events.

## üéØ Current Game State (as of last check)

### Database Status
```sql
-- Active players at table 1
+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+
| user_id | seat_position | username | is_active |
+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+
|      -6 |             0 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Bluff Master Betty
|      -5 |             1 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Pro Player Paul  
|      -7 |             2 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Conservative Carl
|      -3 |             3 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Rock Solid Rick
|      -8 |             4 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Wild West Willie
|      -2 |             5 | NULL     |         1 | -- AI: Loose Lucy
|       1 |             6 | demo     |         1 | -- Human: demo user ‚≠ê
+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+
```

### Game State
- **Current Player**: Position 6 (demo user's turn)
- **Demo User Cards**: K‚ô• A‚ô† (excellent starting hand)
- **Game Phase**: Pre-flop
- **Pot**: ~$0.03
- **Status**: Waiting for demo user action

### Frontend Status
- ‚úÖ All 7 players visible around table
- ‚úÖ Turn detection logic working  
- ‚úÖ Action buttons should appear
- ‚ùå WebSocket actions fail with "Player not at table"

---

## üîß System Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Socket.IO client
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript, Socket.IO server
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 
- **Caching**: Redis 7
- **Container**: Docker Compose

### Key Files Modified
1. `/backend/src/routes/poker.ts` - API field mapping fixes
2. `/frontend/src/pages/games/PokerGame.tsx` - Turn detection logic
3. `/backend/src/socket/pokerHandler.ts` - WebSocket table initialization & JSON parsing

### API Endpoints Working
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/poker/tables` - List tables
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/poker/table/1` - Get table state with players
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/poker/game-state/1` - Get current game state
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/poker/join` - Join table
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/poker/start-game` - Start new game
- ‚ùå WebSocket `poker:action` - Player actions (fails at memory lookup)

---

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix "Player not at table" Error
1. **Add Debug Logging**: 
   ```typescript
   // In handlePlayerAction after player loading
   console.log('Loaded players into memory:', Array.from(pokerTable.players.keys()));
   console.log('Looking for userId:', userId);  
   console.log('Player found:', pokerTable.players.has(userId));
   ```

2. **Verify Database Query**: Check if the player loading query in WebSocket handler returns user_id = 1

3. **Test Memory Mapping**: Ensure `pokerTable.players.set(dbPlayer.user_id, player)` is called correctly

### Priority 2: Test Action Flow
Once WebSocket actions work:
1. Click Call/Fold/Raise button
2. Verify game progresses to next player or next betting round
3. **GOAL**: See the flop cards appear! üÉèüÉèüÉè

### Priority 3: Stabilize WebSocket Connection
- Fix CORS issues
- Implement proper reconnection handling
- Remove dependency on API fallback

## üèÜ Success Criteria

**Primary Goal**: User can click action buttons and see poker game progress to show community cards (flop).

**Definition of Done**:
1. ‚úÖ User sees all players around table
2. ‚úÖ Action buttons appear when it's user's turn  
3. ‚ùå **Clicking buttons processes the action successfully**
4. ‚ùå **Game advances to next phase (flop, turn, river)**
5. ‚ùå **Community cards become visible**

**The final step is fixing the WebSocket player lookup to enable poker actions!** üéØ
